                <h4>Rachel Anne Moore is a Seattle born coloratura soprano who has traveled the US and Europe singing musical theater and opera professionally. Ms. Moore trained at the renowned Indiana University Jacobs School of Music, receiving a Bachelor of Music in vocal performance and working under the tutelage of Professors Patricia Wise and Andreas Poulimenos. After her undergraduate studies, she went on to pursue her Master of Music degree at the University of Tennessee Knoxville as the 2008/2009 Spivey Humanities Fellowship recipient, studying with Professor Marjorie Bennett Stephens. During her Master’s, Ms. Moore was a part of the Knoxville Opera Studio as one of their Studio Artists, understudying and performing leading roles with the Knoxville Opera at the Tennessee State Theater. During that time, she also took part in summer programs such as Opera North in New Hamphire, a program for burgeoning young artists.</h4>

                <h4>Among Ms. Moore‘s opera and operetta credits are the roles of Donna Anna in „Don Giovanni,“ Abigail Williams in „The Crucible,“ Frasquita in „Carmen,“ Lauretta in „Gianni Schicchi,“ Mabel in „The Pirates of Penzance,“ Kathie in „The Student Prince,“ and Mrs. Fiorentino in „Street Scene.“</h4>

                <h4>In 2012 Ms. Moore moved to Europe to pursue her career there where she was scouted for the role of Carlotta Giudicelli in the Hamburg, Germany revival of Lord Andrew Lloyd Webber‘s „Das Phantom der Oper,“ a role which she went on to perform more than 500 times. After her 2 years singing the part of the opera diva Carlotta, she was cast as Christine Daae in the first German company of „Liebe stirbt nie,“ the sequel to „The Phantom of the Opera.“ Currently she can be seen as the alternate Christine Daae with the 1st National US Tour of „Love Never Dies.“</h4>


                <h4>Ms. Moore occasionally gives masterclasses and maintains several students both in the US as well as in Germany. YouTube videos demonstrating and explaining vocal technique in both English and German can be found on her YouTube channel and glimpses into tour life can be found on her Instagram profile.</h4>
